# Level Goal
# The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can
# only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, 
# but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. 
# Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
